# Kevin Coffey || kevdougful

Welcome to my code book!

## ðŸ”­ Current Projects

- [Coffey Family Recipe Book](https://coffey.family)
  - For now, this is a static site generated from markdown using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and automatically deployed to an S3 static site with AWS CodePipeline.
  - The site is distributed by CloudFront.
  - Eventually, I'd like to integrate an authentication system (Cognito, auth0... don't know yet) so that my family members can contribute without having to figure out what a PR is.
